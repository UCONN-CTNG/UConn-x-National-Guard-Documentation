# Possible Extensions

A possible extension for this scenario would be to provide additional vulnerabilities into the web server. The current vulnerability is not one that regularly shows up in the real world. It is a simple error we included in our code to allow low level practice with the systems. Another possible extension would be to include a MySQL database. This would allow for training to defend against attacks against various different systems. However, this would require looking further into linking up MySQL databases with Active Directory or adding another form of logging that would make the scenario realistic to the real world. Finally, the login mechanism for the Apache Server could be improved. The current version is not realistic and does not provide the same functionality a real website would. This could make training not as helpful for members of the cybersecurity team.

# Conclusion

In the end we decided to use LDAP and Active Directory in order to utilize the logging options available within Active Directory. This also allowed us to set up users through Active Directory, which may be more realistic to situations in the real world. This scenario is a fairly simple one and works off an exploit that should not exist for any real world company. However, it provides a good platform for practice using Active Directory. Members of the National Guard can practice using the logging features and manually going through various parts of the system to find suspicious activity. This scenario also acted as good training for our team (as well as good reference for any other future scenario makers) on how to set up and automate the creation of virtual machine resources.
