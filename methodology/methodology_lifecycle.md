# Extreme Programming Lifecycle
Our bi-weekly meetings with our corporate sponsor provide a perfect timeframe for our development cycle since we must have working software to present every two weeks. The iteration cycle of Extreme Programming can be seen below.

## Release Plan
The overall project must be completed by our graduation in May 2021 so this provides a strict deadline. However, a more fluid release plan that we are implementing is to complete each cyber range scenario in approximately two months. This is not strict and we are more focused on the quality of each scenario. 

## Iteration Plan
The iteration plan as already discussed will be every two weeks where we determine what we need to produce for the next demonstration. The feedback provided every two weeks helps us to produce software that is valuable to our sponsor.

## Acceptance Test
We do not necessarily have a dedicated acceptance test where we determine what criteria the software will have to meet. The closest practice that we have to an acceptance test would be integrating our software and creating a demonstration for each corporate meeting. This means that our acceptance test timeline is the same as our iterative plan timeline, but we do decide what features that we created will be valuable to present to the sponsor.

## Stand-up Meeting
Our weekly stand-up meeting goes over what the team is currently working on, what we have achieved recently, and any mid-iteration changes we need to make.

## Pair Negotiation
Pair negotiation is not done on a specific time frame because we are always working as a team unless otherwise agreed upon. Therefore, we continuously practice pair negotiation with the benefit of having everyoneâ€™s input. This is possible because we have such a small team to work with.

## Unit Test
The unit tests that we implement are not up to par with normal Extreme Programming practices. We do not develop tests prior to development because of the highly flexible aspect of this project. This provides more creativity within development to produce the most valuable solution we can devise.

## Pair Programming
Finally, coding is done through pair programming or in our case mob programming since it is done with the entire team.
