# Extreme Programming
The Software Design Methodology that we are utilizing is a flavor of [Extreme Programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/)\(XP\) which is an [Agile](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/) framework. 

## Values
The following are the XP core values:

- Simplicity
- Communication
- Feedback
- Respect
- Courage

More details on these values can be found [here](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html)

## Mob Programming
We are practicing XP and implementing all of the values through [mob programming](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mob-programming/) which means the entire development team is working on the same piece of code at the same time. 

The structure of our mob programming sessions is that we will all be viewing the same console and while one person types, the others will be providing ideas, discussing and doing research. 

For this Senior Design project, we have a large amount of learning to do while working on our deliverables which is very conducive to mob programming. The majority of our team can be researching in order to provide relevant information for the rest of the team. Therefore, everyone will be learning at the same time to increase efficiency and consistency.

## Frequent and Regular Meetings
Our regular meetings with both our team and our corporate sponsor are another demonstration of XP in practice. 

Internally, we meet weekly which is not as often as [standard XP stand-ups](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/standupmeeting.html) occur, but in the context of how many hours we are working between meetings, this is relatable to a daily stand-up in the classic workplace. 

Our meetings with our corporate sponsor occur bi-weekly in which we discuss the progress we have made, usually demonstrating the working code we have produced, and get feedback regarding what our next steps should be.
