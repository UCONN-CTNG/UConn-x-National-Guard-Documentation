- **Action Items**: 
	- **Feedback on each other's papers by the 25th**
		- "Comment on the content of each paper, not grammar." - Ben
	- Clean up team meeting notes and send them to CTNG, along with reminder regarding access info

------------


- Notes from Ben on the writing assignment:
	1. **Paper structure**:
	Lend the structure of the paper to what helps the reader learn best.
	Add figures to help the reader understand.
	Signposting
	2.  **Introducing topics**:
	In each sentence only talk about at most one topic.
	Each sentence should either introduce a new topic or expand on a topic, never both.
	3. **Opinion vs fact**:
	Carefully separate opinion from fact in your essay -- distinguish your opinion (or someone else's opinion) from fact.
	The essay should have both facts about your methodology as well as your opinion on them.


- Last week we sent the AUP/NDAs
- Put team meeting notes in mkdocs and email relevant notes (and reminder) to the CTNG tomorrow
- In 2 weeks we have the website defacement demo, with and without labtainers
- [Juice-Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/ "Juice-Shop") might provide a good vulnerable website.
- Look into alternative websites to deface.
- "Start with a small/simple scenario" - Ben
