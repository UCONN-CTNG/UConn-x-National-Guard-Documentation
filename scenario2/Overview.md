# Scenario 2 (Ransomware):

# Goal:

The goal of this scenario is to mimic a ransomware attack. The ransomware created by the team will encrypt files on the simulated victim's drive and will deploy a ransom note. This allows for members of the cyberdefense team to practice against ransomware attacks, as well as attacks that are communicated over the net.

# Use Cases:

Members of the National Guard Cyberdefense team can use this scenario as a training exercise against ransomware attacks and common practices for analyzing and securing vulnerable systems.

# Technologies Used:

**Netcat**: A computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.

**7-Zip**: A free and open-source file archiver, a utility used to place groups of files within compressed containers known as "archives".
